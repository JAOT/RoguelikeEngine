# RoguelikeEngine
A barebones roguelike project in c#. Very early WIP!!

Platform agnostic. The dungeon generator works with the random walk method, with the code behind it in need for a bit of an improvement, coming in later.
Planning:
- More dungeon generation methods
- A way to create and place entities around the map
- A Quest engine
- Item engine
- FOV (currently being implemented)
- Moving logic, obviously

The project is way in it's infancy, so there's not much to show yet, except this pretty picture of a generated dungeon, with the player and the FOV that at the moment just ignores whatever is in front.
